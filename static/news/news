{"title": "Change Detection Optimization in Frequently Changing Web Pages", "content": "Web pages at present have become dynamic and frequently changing, compared to the past where web pages contained static content which did not change often. People have the need to keep track of web pages which are of interest to them, using bookmarks in the web browser and continuously keep track of them in order to get the updates. Tracking changes which occur in these bookmarked web pages and getting updates has become a significant challenge in the current context.", "image": "news/news2/image.jpg", "reference": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317286196_Change_Detection_Optimization_in_Frequently_Changing_Web_Pages"}
