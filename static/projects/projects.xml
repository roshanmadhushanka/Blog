        <title> Parallel Matrix Multiply </title>
        <description>
            Parallel Matrix Multiplication is C language based method that efficiently multiply matrices with the help
            of parallel-for implementation in OpenMP library. Apart from that, performance has further improved by optimizing
            algorithm to reduce cache misses.

        <title> Feature Processor </title>
        <description>
            Feature processor is a python platform where you can do feature engineering to your dataset. All the underline
            functionality in Feature Processor is based on pandas, scipy numpy, sklearn-pandas and other python libraries.
            This processing platform only support data in CSV format with headers.

        <title> Feature Engineering for Machine Learning </title>
        <description>
            This repository will give you a basic idea about how to use feature engineering along side with machine learning.
            All the new feature engineering processes that describe here have been carried out using python featureeng package.
            The simulation has done for NASA Turbofan Degradation and Yahoo Web Scope data sets
